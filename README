s3d - Simple 3D
---------------

Description:
s3d is a 3d engine.

WARNING!
This engine is not even a pre alpha version!  
 - There is no standard yet. So, if you create your models, worlds, 
   textures or whatever today, they won't probably work tomorrow.
 - If you run this software on a server in the internet you will be
   tasty cracker food!  I try to fix bugs if I see them but I work
   alone at the moment.
 - My English sucks.  I try to document everything but I can't
   guarantee that you understand it ;)
 - This software will crash or maybe not even compile.
You've been warned, HF :)

Dependences:
* SDL
* OpenGL
* cmake
* ossp-uuid

Compile and install:
   cd s3d/
   cmake .
